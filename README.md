# Retail-Store-Inventory-Forecasting
## This dataset provides synthetic yet realistic data for analyzing and forecasting retail store inventory demand. It contains over 73000 rows of daily data across multiple stores and products, including attributes like sales, inventory levels, pricing, weather, promotions, and holidays.

## The dataset is ideal for practicing machine learning tasks such as demand forecasting, dynamic pricing, and inventory optimization. It allows data scientists to explore time series forecasting techniques, study the impact of external factors like weather and holidays on sales, and build advanced models to optimize supply chain performance.

# Data Collection:
## This dataset is collected from Kaggle 9https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anirudhchauhan/retail-store-inventory-forecasting-dataset) which is retail_store_inventory.csv: This dataset has 15 columns and contains
